      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>In all honesty I am a person that admires furniture with all its fine details and the different styles to a point that I consider it to be art and that is what my website is all about. My website is focused on sharing pictures of the different types of household furniture as I have come to notice that there are a variety of them. Also, as we get to do this, we might get inspiration from others as we might get to mimic the various art works of others and add them to our own collections. Even though there might be other websites that offer the same things that I have already addressed, those sites compose images of their own products rather than share creations and artworks of other people.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site is intended to help one another share various ideas of furniture as it well known that there are different types of them. We all want for our surroundings to be well furnished and to be very appealing, yet we don’t know were to start or what to items to choose or purchase and that is the whole idea behind this site, as it gives a person which sort of furniture would be best for their environment. Whether be it for our offices or for our homes, everything is available for you to pick and decide on.</p>  <!-- change this -->
      <p> This site is to help people with their questions that are like “Which type of color should I pick” or “What type of design is the right type to choose”. These are type of questions that are commonly asked by people as they shop for furniture and as a response to this, we also provide hints that people should consider such as the color of the walls in that room, also it’s not a good thing to mix furniture that have different colors as it makes the scenery of the environment seem to be in disarray. For reasons like these is why we give out tips and hints, but not all the time.</p>
