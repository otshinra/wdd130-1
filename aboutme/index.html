    <p>Hey everyone! Let me make a brief introduction about myself. I am the elsest child in a family of two as I live
        with my mother and sister as my father passed away in 2017. I am from Zimbabwe and I live in its capital, Harare
        as it is a very busy city.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the of Jesus christ of Latter-day Saints for only a year now, but I can tell that there
        has been a change in my way of living even in the way that I see things now.</p>
    <p>Currently I am not going to work due to the pandamic that had affected a lot of the things that I was doing at
        that time, so I have decided to focus on my academics for now. The thing that I love about BYU-Idaho is that it
        is simple and easy to understand apart from other online institutes that I have seen. In terms of my coding
        skills, they are not something that I am proud of as of now, but I know that they will grow with time.</p>
    <p>I am really glad to be in this class with all of you and I look forward to getting to know all of you. Thank you
        for viewing my web page.</p>
